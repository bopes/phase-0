<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was pretty cool, but I'm looking forward to using CSS to start adding design elements.  The page still looks pretty 90s. I'm surprised by how basic Berkshire Hathaway's site actually is!

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I enjoyed it. I could envision using Divs to break the page into sections and a table to organize the links in the middle, but we decided against taking that route.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Pretty well.  I made sure to watch the indents and didn't use any formatting at all.  I did prep some text with a span, in anticipation of the CSS.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

It does a great job of organizing text into an outline form. It is more limited when it comes to actual page design and placement, so I'm excited to use CSS to expand on that.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

I also use h1...h6 in order. I consider the tags like parentheses so I remember to close them. If I have a lot of lines with similar tags, like the list of links in Berkshire's site, I type the text first and then fill in the <a href=... >'s and </a>'s afterward so I don't have to type each one separately.
