## 4.2 Reflection

### Release 1

#### What does puts do?

'puts' prints the result of your program to the console.

#### What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a non-decimal number (1, 2, -3, etc.). A float is a number that includes a decimal, even if that is a whole numer (0.5, 435.346234, 4.0, etc).

#### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division returns the exact value of the program, which can be a float itself. Integer division returns the result, but if the result isn't a whole number, it will round down to the nearest integer. For instance, in float division (9.0/2.0)=4.5, but in integer division (9/2)=4. Integer division essentially calculates the results, just without a remainder.

### Reflection Questions

#### How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

It uses the +, -, *, and / symbols to perform calculations between numbers.

#### What is the difference between integers and floats?

Integers are whole numbers (positive or negative), whereas floats include a decimal place.

#### What is the difference between integer and float division?

Float division returns the exact amount. Integer division rounds the result down to the first whole number.

#### What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are sets of letters or numbers that are stored as text. You would use them for a value that doesn't rquire calculation.

#### What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are variables assigned to your computer that you can reference multiple times.

#### How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This was a pretty good review of the basic objects. I liked reviewing how to define variables.
