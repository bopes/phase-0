## 4.2 Reflection

### What does puts do?

'puts' prints the result of your program to the console.

### What is an integer? What is a float?

An integer is a non-decimal number (1, 2, -3, etc.). A float is a number that includes a decimal, even if that is a whole numer (0.5, 435.346234, 4.0, etc).

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Float division returns the exact value of the program, which can be a float itself. Integer division returns the result, but if the result isn't a whole number, it will round down to the nearest integer. For instance, in float division (9.0/2.0)=4.5, but in integer division (9/2)=4. Integer division essentially calculates the results, just without a remainder.
