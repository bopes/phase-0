			<h1>Structure of a Document in HTML 4</h1>

			<p>The structure of a document, i.e., the semantic structure of what is between &lt;body>and &lt;/body&gt;, is fundamental to presenting the page to the user. HTML4 uses the notion of sections and sub-sections of a document to describe its structure. A section is defined by a (&lt;div&gt;) element with heading elements (&lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, &lt;h4&gt;, &lt;h5&gt;, or &lt;h6&gt;) within it, defining its title. The relationships of these elements leads to the structure of the document and its outline.</p>
